# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor
This project implements a RISC-V processor using a single-cycle architecture. Each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle, offering simplicity in design. The processor also includes Control and Status Register (CSR) functionality for system-level control and seamless exception handling.
